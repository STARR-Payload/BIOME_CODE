I have created a server with a virtual arduino uno running on it (working on getting sensors working) 
if you want to test your code or do any work without having to haul around the whole experiment contact me on slack (Christiaan)
I will give you access to a personal user account on the server where you can login and run all your code there

Assuming you have it already since you are a coder but u will need some way to ssh (I can help with using arduino in VS)
