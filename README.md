# STARR-Payload
STARR Code for Arduino interface with sensors and control systems. University of Alberta Rocketry Team.

# To Do's:




# Assigned Tasks:




# Problems:




# Components that require code:

- I^2C Bus components
- Solenoid Valves
- Altimeter/s (very dependant on deployed or not)
- buzzer for debug since lcd would require way too many pins


# Dont Do's:

- Connect IO pin to ground
- Connect 2 IO pins
- When pins are output be super careful 
- Overvolting IO pins
