# STARR-Payload
STARR Code for Arduino interface with sensors and control systems. 

# To Do's:




# Assigned Tasks:




# Problems:




# Components that require code:

-Humidity and Temperature
-Temperature (Thermaresistor) (maybe get higher sensitivity one)
-Solenoid Valves
-Whatever gas sensors we choose (multiple here)
-Altimeter/s (very dependant on deployed or not)
-Camera
-Pressure maybe
-very accurate accelerometer/gyroscope
-buzzer for debug since lcd would require way too many pins


#Dont Do's:

- Connect IO pin to ground
- Connect 2 IO pins
- When pins are output be super careful 
- Overvolting IO pins
