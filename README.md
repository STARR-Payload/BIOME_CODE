# STARR-Payload
STARR Code for Arduino interface with sensors and control systems. University of Alberta Rocketry Team.

# Important 
- If you need access to the arduino server please go to /Extras/readme_for_access.txt
- c_cpp_properties.json file is specific to the project author and will require paths to be changed if ran on other machines. This is due to arduino cli and how libraries are loaded. Dynamic build paths can be used but ugh.


# To Do's:

 - 


# Assigned Tasks:

- Software to make header file for temperature sensors 
- Software to make parsing code for data 
  - Pending till I get format 
- Christiaan to make header files for all sensors 
  - BLANK
- Christiaan to work on main.ino


# Problems:

- 


# Dont Do's:

- Connect 2 IO pins
- When pins are output be super careful 
- Overvolting IO pins
