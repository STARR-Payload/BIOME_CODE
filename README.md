# STARR-Payload
STARR Code for Arduino interface with sensors and control systems. 

# To Do's:





# Whos doing what:




# Problems:



# Components that require code:

-Humidity and Temperature
-Temperature (Thermaresistor) (maybe get higher sensitivity one)
-Solenoid Valves
-Whatever gas sensors we choose (multiple here)
-Altimeter/s (very dependant on deployed or not)
-Camera
-Pressure maybe
-very accurate accelerometer/gyroscope
