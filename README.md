# STARR-Payload
STARR Code for Arduino interface with sensors and control systems. University of Alberta Rocketry Team.

# Important 
- If you need access to the arduino server please go to /Extras/readme_for_access.txt
- c_cpp_properties.json file is specific to the project author and will require paths to be changed if ran on other machines. This is due to arduino cli and how libraries are loaded. Dynamic build paths can be used but ugh.
